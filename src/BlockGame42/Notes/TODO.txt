- entity collision
- entity raycasting
- gui
- items?
- infinite worlds
	- worldgen
		- biomes?
- find texture art
	- maybe 32x32 actual pictures?
- 64 trees?
	- or just store mask as 64 bit for faster raycasting?

- convert to fully spatial (position based) hash so gi shader can sample previous light instead of tracing reflections

long term
- serialization (rip system out of spacegame?)
- multiplayer (woah)

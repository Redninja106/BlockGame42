- entity collision
- entity raycasting
	-entity bvh?
- gui
- items?
- infinite worlds
	- worldgen
		- biomes?

- find texture art
	- maybe 32x32 actual pictures?

- graphics:
	- raytracing acceleration (mipmaps)
	- halton sequences for faster ray convergence
	- use pointer into blockmesh array for custom block shapes (& maybe improved memory efficency)

- fluids

long term
- serialization (rip system out of spacegame?)
- multiplayer (woah)

SDL
- fix 3d texture mipmap bug on uav creation
- add GPU timing api ?

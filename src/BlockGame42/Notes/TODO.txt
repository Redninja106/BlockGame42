- entity collision
- entity raycasting
	-entity bvh?
- gui
- items?
- infinite worlds
	- worldgen
		- biomes?
- find texture art
	- maybe 32x32 actual pictures?
- 64 trees?
	- or just store mask as 64 bit for faster raycasting?

- graphics:
	- raytracing acceleration (mipmaps or 64 trees)
	- halton sequences for faster ray convergence



long term
- serialization (rip system out of spacegame?)
- multiplayer (woah)

SDL
- fix 3d texture mipmap bug on uav creation
- add GPU timing api ?

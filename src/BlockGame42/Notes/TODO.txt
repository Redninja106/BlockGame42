- gui
- items?
- infinite worlds
	- worldgen
		- biomes?
- find texture art
	- maybe 32x32 actual pictures?
- 64 trees?
	- or just store mask as 64 bit for faster raycasting?

- graphics:
	- accumulated radiance decay
		- idea: instead of accumulating, each hashmap entry is a small ring buffer containings n frames of 8 bit irradiance, where irradiance is averaged over n frames
			- would greatly increase memory footprint but increasing samples per frame and using 8 bit irradiance would offset this
			- can not clear hashmap on chunk updates 
			- block ids must be spatially coherent
				- sm 6.6 64bit atomics/bitpacked position
				- bitpack chunkid & chunk-local position <--- 32*16=2^9=9bits/dim; 5 bit chunkid... not very many chunks
				- seperate chunkid & chunk-local position
				- hash+checksum (like rtgems2ch41) hash x,y,z,n		

	- reflective materials
	- convert to fully spatial (position based) hash so gi shader can sample previous light instead of tracing bounces (& for lighting in reflections)
	- raytracing acceleration (mipmaps or 64 trees)
	- halton sequences for faster ray traversal

long term
- serialization (rip system out of spacegame?)
- multiplayer (woah)

SDL
- fix 3d texture mipmap bug on uav creation
- add GPU timing api ?
